<div>
    The minimal rate between instances of an event and calls into its containing code an event of a non-critical type (e.g. uncaught) must take place to be considered severe within the active timeframe window. For example, for an event that happened 200 out of 1000 calls this value must be set at 0.2 and up for the event to qualify as a potential regression.
