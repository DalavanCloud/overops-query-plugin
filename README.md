# OverOps Query Jenkins Plugin

The plugin provides a mechanism for querying OverOps as a post build step to ensure continuous reliability. Check OverOps for new errors and exceptions introduced by the build.   


## Installation
  Prerequisites

  * Jenkins running on Java 1.8 or later
  


## Global Configuration

  Select Manage Jenkins -> Configure Plugin 
  scroll down to **OverOps Query Plugin**
  
  **OverOps URL:**  The complete url including port of the OverOps e.g. http://localhost:8080 or for SaaS  https://api.overops.com

  **Retry Count**  Number of times to execute the query as a single post-build step.

  **Retry Interval**  Time to wait in between each query in seconds.
